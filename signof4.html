<p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Sherlock Holmes strode over to the dark cherry-wood cabinet on long legs, sweeping across the parlour. Fumbling with the small key, he regarded the contents thoughtfully before taking out a slim bottle, the amber-gold liquid glinting inside. It was a moment more before he withdrew an ornate tumbler as well, after which he strode back over to his velvet armchair. </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
He sunk into the comfort of the deep purple lining and uncorked the bottle, pouring it carefully into the chiseled glass. Once filled to the brim, Sir Holmes lifted the glass to his lips and drained it in one draught. He sighed, a long, long sigh of profound satisfaction, glancing over at the framed painting of himself on the wall.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
A cobalt blue dragon in the armchair opposite, just barely a meter tall, sniffed with a dragon’s refined sense of disdain at being roused from his slumber. He shuttered his brown slitted eyes briefly as if it would remove him from the scene, before opening them again to behold Sir Holmes imbibing yet more of the amber-gold liquid.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
 “Which of the fey liquors is it today?” He asked, the high pitched tones holding a note of exasperation.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes languidly raised his head to settle his eyes on his squawking companion.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“It is one of my own concoctions, Watson, a combination of the finest human meads with a selection of other fey spirits. Would you care to sample it?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“No,” Watson answered bluntly, “You know I simply cannot abide your over-glorified fermented honey. You know that from the moment that it touches your lips it causes you harm. Why then, would you subject yourself to such a substance?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes smiled in amusement at the dragon’s frustration. “Perhaps you make a good point against your perception of the point of the consumption of liquor. But the point you are making is not the point for which I am consuming it in the first place,” he said. “It is not for mere entertainment, nor pleasure. As you know, the fey are masters of revels and the stimulation of the mind. It is that which concerns me.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson lifted himself up in earnest, “Your mind may be distracted, but when you must weaken your body to invigorate your mind, surely you must think before you make the metaphorical leap! Fey liquors do as you say, temporarily stimulate the mind, but in return, permanently weaken the body. Why should you risk yourself for passing pleasures? I ask this of you not only as a dragon with the gift and a career in medicine, but as your partner in adventure. Would you cut short your already brief life for even briefer moments?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
The man raised himself with renewed vitality, eyes bright with the prospect of intelligent debate. “My mind is not like of the common peoples,” he started, with the air of one who knows that they are completely, absolutely in the right. “I loathe the dull monotony of life. Give me any sort of onerous and intricate quandary of the likes of the High Fae for me to ruminate over. Let me decode the most obscure and esoteric cipher from the ancient mysteries of gods in distant lands. Then I may relinquish the passing pleasures for I have already achieved the ecstasy that comes with the unraveling of a mystery. Else, if I am bereft of such things, I will find other ways to occupy myself - this is why I have offered my particular services, the only one of its kind in the world.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson shifted onto his haunches and cocked his head, “You seem to be speaking another branch of Human entirely, as always. A knight?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“No,” Sir Holmes said, “The only unofficial inquisitorial knight. I am the one who is called upon when Gregson, Lestrade, or Athelney Jones fail to find the missing treasure or slay the terrible ogre. It is I who untangles the the threads of information to give a completed weave, it is I who finishes the work that others have failed to do. But you have already witnessed my procedure of thought in the pursuit of the elf, Jefferson Hope.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Indeed,” the dragon said settling himself down again, “I found it quite absorbing, and I sought to memorialize it within a book with the title of ‘A Study in Scarlet’.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes peered at the dragon. “You do not possess opposable thumbs.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
The familiar curve of a smile appeared upon Watson’s face. “I have my ways.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes raised a brow, “How so?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“I thought it into being with sheer force of will.” The dragon deadpanned.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
The man leaned back with a chuckle, “However it came to be, I find that I cannot congratulate you upon it. I find that it was meandering in places, and the amorous overtones were ill placed. The situation was one of murder, not romance.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson twitched his tail, “I described what I saw,” he said, “If I am to accurately record the events, I cannot simply disregard them. That is not how my gift works.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Some events were irrelevant and should be treated so. The only point that should have been the focus of the book was how I succeeded in solving the murders,” Sir Holmes said, in a purely factual manner.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson flattened his ears, and sat up straighter, narrowing his slitted eyes at Sir Holmes.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
It was a short while until Sir Holmes spoke again, pouring himself yet another glass of the mixed liquor. “I have had somewhat of an apprentice recently, a young squire who had consulted me on several matters, and it only took a few suggestions before he was able to find the troll’s den himself. He is quite observant, and is a quick study in drawing deductions from his observations, but has not yet attained the degree of knowledge required to be truly great. But of course,” Sir Holmes said, with an acknowledging tilt of his head, “Such knowledge will surely come in time.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Sherlock,” the dragon started, “You have just spoken of deduction and observation, but what exactly is the difference between? Your specific branch of Human is quite a particular language, with words having only minute differences from the other. Surely deduction and observation are similar?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes stretched out in his armchair, swirling his glass. “Only slightly. Observation is the act of simply looking and pointing the facts out. Deduction is the act of applying your knowledge and common sense to the facts you have obtained by looking.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson thought it over, punctuating the following silence with the sporadic swishes of a scaled tail.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“I think myself to understand,” he started, “But would you permit me to give you a test?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes set his glass aside, and leaned on his knees to link his fingers together. “Of course, I would be delighted to investigate anything you may give to me.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson leaped off the chair to slink onto the table beside Sir Holmes, with a slight limp in his gait. “Of my hoard, I have recently acquired a handsome ceremonial dagger. I should like you to have an opinion of the last owner.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
As he said this, Watson withdrew an embellished dagger, the handle made of gold and the blade of smooth, mirror-like silver.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes took it gently in his hands, examining first the hilt, then the naked blade. He first observed both with his eyes, then with a version of a reading-stone. When Sir Holmes set the dagger back onto the table without saying a word, it was Watson who couldn’t hide the look of amusement on his draconian features.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“There is no sheath,” Sir Holmes said.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Correct,” Watson answered, “It was given to me without one.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Then I shall start, Sir Holmes said, knotting his fingers together again once more. “I believe that this particular dagger belonged to your father, and was then passed on to your older brother.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“I suppose you gleaned that from the initials engraved in the pommel?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Yes. The W. is indicative of your surname. The style of the dagger is quite old, and although dragons are much more long lived than humans, I know that you are not nearly old enough for this to have been your possession. I do not know much about draconian customs, just finding one is hard enough, so I deduct that it had fallen to your older brother, as you have recently gained it and your father has been dead many years before.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“You are correct,” said Watson. “Have you any other observations and deductions?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Your older brother was careless. He did have a sizable inheritance, but had squandered it, living precariously on the thin line between poverty and prosperity before he died of the liquors you detest so much.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson snarled and lunged towards Sir Holmes in an aborted movement, turning instead to the surface of the stone table and scratching thin white lines in the marble. He fanned his leathery wings, and letting the light glint off the sharp claws at the tips.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“This is very poor of you, Holmes,” Watson snapped, “I thought you better than this, Sir Knight. You have investigated my brother, my family and now you make as if you had deducted this knowledge in some mysterious way. How dare you! This is quite mean spirited of you, and frankly, I thought that you would have had the decency to admit that you didn’t deduce this from a dagger.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes reached towards Watson, “Oh my dear dragon,” he said softly, “I had no intention of insult, and for that I apologize for not thinking how it would look for you. I truly did not know that you had a brother, or even a sibling before you gave me the dagger for me to deduct from.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Then however did you do it?” Watson growled, still not recovered from the shock of hurt.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“First, I said that he was careless,” Sir Holmes began, speaking softly at first, then rising in both tone and volume. “Look at the scratches and dents on the pommel and blade. Surely one who treats such an obviously expensive ceremonial dagger so must be careless. Second, if he received a ceremonial dagger, he must have received at least several other objects of great import and cost, correct?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Watson dipped his head quickly, the cobalt scales glimmering.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“Third, dragons have quite distinctive scales and patterns, and those scales are quite hard. When handling such soft metals, your scales press into the hilt and blade, leaving quite distinguishable marks that are easily observed by any trained professional. See on the grip here, there are several different patterns from different dragons grasping it. Since dragons are very partial to their hoard, they would not part with it lightly, and only in dire situations, such as if they were in need of money. Because it had passed from him to you, I deduced that he must have bought back the dagger, and quite a few times at that. Finally, see how the dagger is corroded in places. Fey liquor is quite corrosive to silver and other ‘pure’ metals such as iron, even more so than water.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes spread his hands, “Do you see?”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“As clear as the open skies in summer,” Watson said, handing his head low. “I am deeply sorry for my insults. I should have had more faith in you, Sherlock.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Sir Holmes didn’t reply, gaze drifting back to the tumbler of alcohol.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
A short ring alerted the pair, bringing their attention past the portrait of Sir Holmes to the great wooden doors of the parlour. Mrs Hudson strode in, towards the most unlikely of partnerships - a knight and a dragon.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“A young lady elf, Sir.” Mrs Hudson began by way of greeting, delivering a card upon the brass salver.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“A female companion? Well, Sir Holmes, I’ll leave you to frolic with your unexpected visitor.” Watson said, flapping his great leathery wings suggestively.
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
“A Miss Mary Morstan,” Sir Holmes read. “Odd. Ask her to step inside, Mrs Hudson.”
 </p><br><p class="letter" style="text-align:left;">
Glancing up to Watson, he spoke, “I should like you to stay, I have a curious inkling in regards to this.”
